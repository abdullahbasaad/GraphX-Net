# GraphX-Net
GraphX-Net provides a powerful tool for clinicians and researchers in the field of breast cancer by combining GNNs with Shapley values. It offers accurate predic- tions of relapse risk while also providing interpretable insights into the underlying factors driving those pre- dictions.

> [!NOTE]
> Breast cancer is a major health problem worldwide, and accurate prediction of its recurrence
is crucial for early detection of recurrence and personalising effective treatment. In recent years, various AI
techniques have been applied to predict cancer recurrence with increasingly high accuracy. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing structured data, including knowledge net-
works. In this study, we explored the application of GNN-based node classification to predict the occurrence
of relapse status in breast cancer patients. We propose a noval model, namely GraphX-Net, Shapley Value-
based Graph Neural Network. GraphX-Net leverages a graph representation by analysing public breast
cancer gene expression data, where nodes represent patients and edges capture relationships between them
based on various factors such as tumour cellularity, histological subtype, hormone therapy, patient vital
status, primary tumour laterality, type of breast surgery, and other clinicopathological parameters. Our
approach integrates diverse data sources and utilizes graph convolutional layers to generate informative
node embeddings. The model uniquely calculates node feature contributions using Shapley values, sets
nodesâ€™ thresholds, and considers the total node neighboring effects. These innovations enable GraphX-Net
to achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting breast cancer recurrence, highlighting its potential as a
powerful tool for improving patient outcomes.
